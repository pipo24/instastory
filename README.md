##Preparation:

  > Pick a problem and solve it using web dev means: internet, google, class-notes, teamworking and your tutors.

###Scope:

    > FOR: -> users of instagram
    > WHO: -> are looking for a better UX and other functionalities
    > OUR BRAND IS: -> a story creating app that allows users to login and collect images from Instagram relating to a specific #hashtag then sorting them into a timeline
    > THAT: -> wants to give users a fast and easy way of collecting their images from a specific event or category and arranging them into an album/story
    > BY: -> taking images using the Instagram API and sorting them into a timeline for users
    > to interact in a further private part of the website
    > BECAUSE: -> it provides a quick and useful resource for users to collect images for an event quickly

###FULL POSITIONING STATEMENT

#####As my final project at GA we were given full autonomy in choosing an idea and the tech we wanted to use.
#####I chose to build a full Backbone static page app where users can create and save an album, as a ‘Story’, using Instagram photos with a specific hashtag.
#####The images are displayed in a similar view to Instagram. Users can then edit/add/remove pictures from it.
  
###MVP:
 
    login through Instagram API
    create a story and request a specific hashtag
    access Instagram API and search through images
    display images in story view (no features)

* **full backbone** front-end
* rails back-end
* devise oath
* instagram api
* bourbon
